Task 2.1: NoSQL Justification Report
NoSQL Database Analysis for FlexiMart Product Catalog

Section A: Limitations of RDBMS
The current relational database faces significant challenges when managing FlexiMart's diverse product catalog. First, schema rigidity becomes problematic when products have vastly different attributes—laptops require specifications like RAM, processor, and screen size, while shoes need size, color, and material. Adding new product types requires ALTER TABLE operations, causing downtime and complexity. Second, storing variable attributes forces either creating sparse tables with many NULL values or implementing complex EAV (Entity-Attribute-Value) patterns that degrade query performance. Third, nested data structures like customer reviews are difficult to model efficiently. Storing reviews in a separate table requires expensive JOIN operations for every product query. Fourth, frequent schema changes when introducing new product categories (e.g., adding "smart home devices" with IoT-specific attributes) require database migrations, testing, and potential application code changes, slowing down business agility and time-to-market for new product lines.

Section B: NoSQL Benefits
MongoDB addresses these limitations through its document-oriented architecture. Flexible schema allows each product document to have unique fields without affecting others—electronics can have "processor" and "RAM" while clothing has "size" and "fabric," all in the same collection. This eliminates NULL values and enables rapid product type additions without schema migrations. Embedded documents allow storing reviews directly within product documents, eliminating JOIN operations and improving read performance. A single query retrieves the complete product with all reviews, reducing database round trips. Horizontal scalability through sharding enables FlexiMart to distribute product data across multiple servers as the catalog grows, maintaining performance at scale. MongoDB's dynamic schema supports agile development—adding new product attributes or categories requires no database changes, only application code updates. This flexibility accelerates feature deployment and supports FlexiMart's evolving business needs without database administration overhead.

Section C: Trade-offs 
Despite its advantages, MongoDB has notable disadvantages for FlexiMart's product catalog. First, lack of ACID transactions across documents (in older versions) makes it challenging to maintain data consistency when updating inventory across multiple products simultaneously or processing orders that affect multiple collections. Second, data redundancy and update anomalies can occur—if a product category name is embedded in multiple documents and needs updating, all documents must be modified individually, risking inconsistencies. MySQL's referential integrity and foreign key constraints automatically prevent orphaned records and maintain consistency, which MongoDB requires application-level enforcement, increasing development complexity and potential for bugs.
